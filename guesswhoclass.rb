# Jen Trudell April 9, 2014


#If guilty suspect doesnâ€™t match the color/gender then remove the suspects of that color/gender
#If guilty suspect matches the color/gender then remove the suspects that are NOT that color/gender.
#Show an updated list of suspects
#User makes a guess by suspect name
#If guess is wrong. Remove the guessed suspect from list. They have 2 more chances. repeat from 1 again. If guess is right. They Win.
#If they use up all their chances. Tell them who the guilty suspect is.
