# Create a Guess Who Game. Rampup Lab class #4.
# Jen Trudell April 13, 2015
# V 2.0: Improves on guesswhoclass.rb aka v 1.0

# Rules:
# If guilty suspect doesnâ€™t match the color/gender then remove the suspects of that color/gender
# If guilty suspect matches the color/gender then remove the suspects that are NOT that color/gender.
# Show an updated list of suspects
# User makes a guess by suspect name
# If guess is wrong. Remove the guessed suspect from list. They have 2 more chances. repeat from 1 again. If guess is right. They Win.
# If they use up all their chances. Tell them who the guilty suspect is.
